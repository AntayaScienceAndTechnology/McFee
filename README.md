# McFee
Python for Richard McFee's 1959 paper 'Optimum Input Leads for Cryogenic Apparatus'
In McFee's 1959 paper on current lead optimization in cryogenic applications, heat load and length-to-area ratio of conductor
are found for an optimized current carrying lead that goes from a warm end to a cold end.

Numpy 1.9.1 and Scipy 0.14.0 were used in the McFee_Functions.py file.
